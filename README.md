# coefficient-reflection-measurer
The coefficient-reflection-measurer application is a final project from the Faculty of Exact Sciences, Engineering, and Surveying at the National University of Rosario, Argentina, developed to obtain the degree in Electronic Engineering. This tool allows you to plot the reflection or absorption coefficient along with the power spectrum of the input signal from one of the microphones in real-time.

## Installation
To install and run the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository on your computer using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/coefficient-reflection-measurer.git
```

Access the repository directory:

```bash
cd coefficient-reflection-measurer
```

Run the start.py file to launch the application:

```bash
python start.py
```

That's it! The application should start and be ready for use.

## System Requirements
The application has no special requirements beyond having a computer capable of running it.

## Documentation
The complete project documentation can be found in the PDF file named Proyecto_adapador_de_impedancia.pdf. This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the required hardware, installation instructions, and how to use the application.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can choose to plot either the reflection or absorption coefficient. Additionally, the real-time power spectrum of the microphone's input signal will be displayed.

## Contribution
At this time, external contributions to the project are not accepted.
